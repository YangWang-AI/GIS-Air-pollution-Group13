## Project Background
Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the air, including gases and particulates, that can negatively impact human health and the environment. The main sources of air pollution include industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, burning of fossil fuels, agricultural activities, and natural events like wildfires and volcanic eruptions. These pollutants contribute to climate change, respiratory diseases, and environmental degradation.
Throughout the GIS Project we will harness the availability of free and open geospatial data (e.g., Copernicus) to study the historical trends of air pollutants (e.g., NO2, PMs) in relation to environmental variables (e.g., Land cover) and evaluate exceedance above the recommended guidelines.

## Project Objectives
• Analyze historical time-series air quality data in relation to land cover types to detect long-term environmental trends.
• Assess population exposure to air pollution, emphasizing areas with pollutant exceedances relative to health guidelines.
• Create an interactive WebGIS and project webpage to visualize results and communicate key findings eectively.

## Project Highlight
Further exploration of spatial and temporal patterns of contaminants around Sofia using potential source and time series analysis
