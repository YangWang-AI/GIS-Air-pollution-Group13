                Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the air, including gases and particulates, that can negatively impact human health and the environment. The main sources of air pollution include industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, burning of fossil fuels, agricultural activities, and natural events like wildfires and volcanic eruptions. These pollutants contribute to climate change, respiratory diseases, and environmental degradation.

          <h3>Location</h3>
          <p>
            The study area for our project is Bulgaria, where, according to a new study by European environmental regulators, Bulgaria's air contains higher levels of several major air pollutants than the air of any other country in Europe, with the highest concentrations of the two main types of particulate matter. Particulates are tiny air droplets or gaseous particles that come from chimneys, car exhausts or various other sources. They can cause health problems ranging from asthma to cancer. Bulgaria also has some of the highest concentrations of carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide in the world, according to the European Environment Agency. And with its history of Soviet-era industrialization, Bulgaria has paid little attention to environmental issues. Given its status as one of Europe's poorer countries, it appears to have made limited progress in air purification. Therefore, air quality mapping for Bulgaria is of particular importance.

          <h3>Natural Environment</h3>
          <p>Bulgaria, located in the south-eastern part of Europe, in the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula, has a diverse and characteristic natural environment. The country's terrain is undulating, with mountainous hills in the west and center, such as the famous Balkan Mountains and the Rila Mountains, in which Musala Peak is the highest point in the entire Balkan Peninsula (2,925 meters). In the south there are the Rhodope Mountains, while in the north there is the Danube Plain with fertile soil suitable for agriculture. In the east, it is bordered by the Black Sea and has a mild and humid coastal climate and a rich coastal ecosystem.
           </p><p> Bulgaria's climate is generally temperate continental, with cold winters and hot summers, but there are also large local variations due to the complex topography. The country has many rivers, such as the Danube and the Maritsa, and lakes, mainly alpine and Black Sea lakes.        
           </p> <p> system of national nature reserves and national parks is well developed and rich in biodiversity, making it one of the most important habitats for European wildlife. Bulgaria is one of the few European countries that still has large tracts of primary forests and is home to rare species such as bears, wolves and golden eagles. Overall, Bulgaria is a country rich in natural resources, with a diverse ecological landscape of mountains, plains, coasts and forests.</p>

          <h3>Main Towns</h3>
          <p>
            Sofia: Sofia is the capital and largest city of Bulgaria. It is situated in the Sofia Valley at the foot of the Vitosha mountain, in the western part of the country. The city is built west of the Iskar river and has many mineral springs, such as the Sofia Central Mineral Baths. It has a humid continental climate. <br />
            Plovdiv: Plovdiv is the second-largest city in Bulgaria, 144 km (93 miles) southeast of the capital Sofia. It had a population of 490,983 as of 2024 and 675,000 in the greater metropolitan area. Plovdiv is a cultural hub in Bulgaria and was the European Capital of Culture in 1999 and 2019. The city is an important economic, transport, cultural, and educational centre. Plovdiv joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2016 <br />
            Varna: Varna is the third-largest city in Bulgaria and the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast and in the Northern Bulgaria region. Situated strategically in the Gulf of Varna, the city has been a major economic, social and cultural centre for almost three millennia. Historically known as Odessos, Varna developed from a Thracian seaside settlement into a major seaport on the Black Sea.
